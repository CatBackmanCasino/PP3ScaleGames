<h1 align="center">Scaletutor 1.0 Beta</h1>

[View the live project here](https://ericpp3.herokuapp.com/)

ScaleTutor is a command line learning tool for learning and/or testing your knowledge of musical scales a.k.a. modes.
Perfect for musicians or anyone interested in music theory.

The tool includes a variety of scales for the user to learn more about and after choosing a scale the user can learn more about the scale, including the scale structure. This can then be used to figure out wich notes are included in the scale in any key.

ScaleTrainer is the first of a range of games aimed to teach different parts of music theory.

## User Experience (UX)

### User stories. 
As a user I want to:
  - Learn more about scales/modes
  - I want be able to choose between a variety of scales.
  - I want to recieve relevant information about chosen scales.
  - I want to get relevant examples of songs using the scale so that i can hear what they sound like.
  - I want to be able to test my understandinig of the chosen scale.
  - I want to be able to see my result, where i went wrong and what notes i missed if any
  - I want to continue playing for as long as i want
  - I want to be able to change scale to learn about after each round.

## Features

### Existing Features

- ###  __Welcome__

    - After starting the app the user is greeted and given a short briefing about the intentions of the programme. The idea is to give the user a basic understanding of what the software can offer.
    The user will then be asked to either start or quit the programme. 

      ![Main Menu](documentation/images/f01-main-menu-1.png)

    - The user has to answer either with 'y' or 'n'. Capital or not has no effect on the programme but any other characters will cause the programme to ask the user to answer with a valid choice. Which are 'y' or 'n'. 

      ![Main Menu Message](documentation/images/f01-main-menu-2.png)

- ###  __Name Entry__
    - The user is prompted to enter a name. The only criteria that needs to be met is that the name entered is at least one character in length. No other criteria needed.
    The name is used to display personalized messages.

      ![Events Menu](documentation/images/f02-manage-events-submenu.png)

- ###  __Scale Menu__

    - Here the users name is used to ask which scale the user want to learn more about or test their knowledge of.
    The user can choose from the seven most used scales/modes in Western music.

    After choosing a scale their choice is displayed.

      ![Active Events](documentation/images/f03-show-active-events.png)

- ###  __Scale Information__
    - After choosing a scale the user is shown information about the chosen scale.
    This information includes basic information about the scale as well as examples of known compositions or songs using the scale and a structure pattern.
    
    ![Add Event](documentation/images/f04-add-event.png)

- ###  __Challenge__
    - After the users has had a chance to learn about the scale they will be given a random key, a command line drawing of a piano and a random key.
    The challenge is to test the users understanding of the scale by entering each note of the scale in the given key using the previously provided scale pattern as a guide.
    
    - The user can only use valid notes to answer or they will be asked to re-enter the answer. 
    - The rules for validation are:
      - Has to be a valid note (C,D,E,F,G,A,B) and the valid sharps. Flats are not used as they are synonymos to the sharp of the previous whole note.
      - Input has to be as many valid notes as the scale contains.
      - All notes has to be separated by a comma.

    ![Add Event](documentation/images/f04-add-event.png)

- ###  __Result__

    - After input passes through validation a result is displayed.
    The result includes:
      - All notes of the correct scale.
      - Correct notes.
      - Wrong notes.
      - Missing notes.
      - Feedback based on the result.

- ###  __Run again__
    - Round one is now finished and the user is asked if they would like to quit or go for another round. 
    If choosing to quit - The software will stop running.
    If choosing to go again they will go back to scale menu.

### __How these features support the User Stories__

  Here are the user stories again with information on how the criteria are met in the application.

### User stories. 
As a user I want to:
- Learn more about scales/modes
  - The application gives information about any chosen scale.
- I want be able to choose between a variety of scales.
  - The application currently includes 7 scales/modes.
- I want to recieve relevant information about chosen scales.
  - The application include relevant information about each scale.
- I want to get relevant examples of songs using the scale so that i can hear what they sound like.
  - After choosing a scale the user recieves information as well as song examples.
- I want to be able to test my understandinig of the chosen scale.
  - After giving the user information and song examples of the scales they are asked to enter each note of the chosen scale in a randomly selected key to test the users understanding of the scale pattern.
- I want to be able to see my result, where i went wrong and what notes i missed if any.
  - After entering a valid answer the user is shown:
    - All notes of the chosen scale in the random key.
    - All correct notes.
    - All wrong notes.
    - All missing notes.
    - A message based on how many notes was correct.
- I want to continue playing for as long as i want.
  - After each round the user is asked to play again or quit.
- I want to be able to change scale to learn about after each round.
  - When starting a new round the user is again asked to choose scale.
- I want to be able to quit the application after each round.
  - After each round the user is asked to play again or quit.

### Features which could be implemented in the future

- __UI__

  Since this is a command line application the  UI is not the best. Creating a visually appealing interface would make the application way more fun.

- __Add scales__
  Music is amazing and there is no shortage of scales. The application currently contain the seven most common scales in western music. But all kind of world scales could easily be added by updating the list of dictionaries of scales and create a txt file with valid information about the scale. All code will work regardless of how many scales are added and the length of the added scale.

- __Add other music theory categoriez__
  - Circle of fifths
  - Chord progressions

## Testing
  The testing of this app has been me trying my best to raise errors.
  The app has also been tested by Greta Lindgren without finding errors or bugs.
  
  The only known bug is listed in "Known bugs".

### Validator Testing
- Code passes through PEP8 with no issues.

### Known bugs
When entering the notes they have be entered without spaces after each comma. Will be added later.

## Deployment

The application was created using Code Institutes template for PP3 and deployed via Heroku.

### Deployment via Heroku

Step 1: Prepping code

  - Remove all commented out code.
  - Remove unnnecesary imports
  - run command :pip3 freeze > requirements.txt (this command will print requirements to requirements.txt. If there are any.)
  
Step 2: Setup Heroku Account
  - Go to http://www.heroku.com
  - Follow the steps to set up an account
  - When the account is set up you will arrive at the Heroku dashbord.

Step 3: Create App
  - Click "Create New App"
  - Give your app a name 
  - Choose your region
  - Confirm by clicking "Create App

Step 4: Set Up App
  - Click "Settings"
  - If app requires sensitive information inside for example a creds.json file, this has to be provided in the "Config Vars" section. Copy the file content and paste it into the "value" section and enter CREDS in the "Key" section.
  In the "Buildpack" section, click "Add Buildpack". 
    - Add the Python buildpack and click "Save Changes
    - Add the node.js Buildpack and click "Save Changes"

Step 5: Deploy
  - On the top of the page, choose "Deploy" in the menu.
  - Select Github in "Deployment Method" section.
  - Confirm that you want to connect to Github by clicking "Connect to Github"
  - In the "Connect to Github" section you can now find your github repositories. Find the one you want to deploy, click "search" and then click "Connect" on the correct repository.
Step 6: Manual or automatic Deployment?
  - If you wish Heroku to automatically re-build your app every time you do a push simply choose automatic deploy.
  - If you wish to manualy control when a new version is deployed choose "manual"
Step 7: View Deployed App
  - After successfully building your app you will see the app has been built successfuly and can now click "view" to test your app.
  Make sure it works.
  You are now online! Congratulations!
