The Phrygian is the third mode.
It is also very similar to the modern natural minor scale.
The only difference is in the second note, which is a minor second not a major.
The Phrygian dominant is also known as the Spanish gypsy scale, because it resembles the scales found in flamenco music.
Music that uses the Phyrigian mode include Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No.2,
Rimsky Korsakov's Scheherezade, Vaughan Williams's Fantasia on a Theme of Thomas Tallis and
the final aria of Philip Glass's Satyagraha.
