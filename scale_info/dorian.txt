The Dorian mode is very similar to the modern natural minor scale.
The only difference is in the sixth note, which is a major sixth above the first note, rather than a minor sixth.
Good examples of the use of Dorian mode in music are:
'Billie Jean' by Michael Jackson, 'Smoke on the Water' by Deep Purple and the traditional Scarborough Fair.
Scale Structure:
Whole, Half, Whole Whole, Whole, Half.
